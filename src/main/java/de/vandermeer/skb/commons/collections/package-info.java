/**
 * Collection types (collection, tables, trees) as implementations of {@link de.vandermeer.skb.composite.CompositeObject} objects.
 * 
 * This package provides a number of collection-like SKB composite types, along with some utility classes.
 * The two main types are a tree and a table. Both come with an interface and a common implementation. Both support generics.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The common tree implementation is essentially a facade for a map, which uses the map's keys as path in a tree.
 * The general mechanism is similar to a file system. The common table implementation is then realised as a tree
 * with restricted maximum depth of the path (2).
